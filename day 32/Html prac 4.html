 <h2 id="topic1">Computing Power</h2>
 <p> 
    Computing power has already established its place in the digital era, with almost every device and appliance being computerized. And it’s here for even more as data science experts have predicted that the computing infrastructure we are building right now will only evolve for the better in the coming years. At the same time, we have 5G already; gear up for an era of 6G with more power in our hands and devices surrounding us. Even better, computing power is generating more tech jobs in the industry but would require specialized qualifications for candidates to acquire. From data science to robotics and IT management, this field will power the largest percentage of employment in every country. The more computing our devices will need, the more technicians, IT teams, relationship managers, and the customer care economy will flourish.
    
    One essential branch under this field that you can learn today is RPA, i.e. Robotic Process Automation. At Simplilearn, RPA is all about computing and automation software that can train you for a high-paying role in the IT industry. Here are the top jobs you can target after RPA: 
    
    Data Scientist
    AI Engineer
    Robotics Researcher
    AI Architect
    Robotics Designer</p>

 <h2 id="topic2">Smarter Devices </h2>

 <p> 
    
Artificial intelligence has played an essential role in making our world smarter and smoother. It is not just simulating humans but going the extra mile to make our life hassle-free and simpler. These smarter devices are here to stay in 2023 and even further, as data scientists are working on AI home robots, appliances, work devices, wearables, and so much more! Almost every job needs smart software applications to make our work life more manageable. Smarter devices are another addition to the IT industry that is of high requirement and demand as more companies transform into digital spaces. Almost every higher-level job requires a good proficiency in IT and automation these days to thrive. This is why Simplilearn’s RPA course can help you master these skills to achieve par excellence in your career, whether in IT, marketing, or management. Here are the best jobs you can venture:

IT Manager
Data Scientists
Product Testers
Product Managers
Automation Engineers
IT Researchers

 <h2 id="topic3">   Datafication</h2>

 <p>
  
Datafication is simply transforming everything in our life into devices or software powered by data. So, in short, Datafication is the modification of human chores and tasks into data-driven technology. From our smartphones, industrial machines, and office applications to AI-powered appliances and everything else, data is here to stay for longer than we can ever remember! So, to keep our data stored the right way and secure and safe, it has become an in-demand specialization in our economy. 

Datafication leads to a higher need for IT professionals, data scientists, engineers, technicians, managers, and so much more. Even more useful is that anyone with a sound knowledge of technology can do a certification in data-related specializations to find a job in this space. Data jobs are more about skills than big-level qualifications, and we have so many successful leaders emerging from smaller cities and developing countries like India. You can also equip yourself with this useful trending skill by doing a course like RPA to help you understand how automation works in the world of data. Let’s look at some popular data careers:

Big Data Engineers
Robotics Engineers
IT Architect
Business Intelligence Analyst
Data Scientists

 <h2 id="topic4">Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning</h2>

 <p>  
    
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in the past decade, but it continues to be one of the new technology trends because of its notable effects on how we live, work and play are only in the early stages. AI is already known for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps, smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.

Other than that AI will be used further to analyze interactions to determine underlying connections and insights, to help predict demand for services like hospitals enabling authorities to make better decisions about resource utilization, and to detect the changing patterns of customer behaviour by analyzing data in near real-time, driving revenues and enhancing personalized experiences.

The AI market will grow to a $190 billion industry by 2025 with global spending on cognitive and AI systems reaching over $57 billion in 2023.  With AI spreading its wings across sectors, new jobs will be created in development, programming, testing, support and maintenance, to name a few. On the other hand AI also offers some of the highest salaries today ranging from over $1,25,000 per year (machine learning engineer) to $145,000 per year (AI architect) - making it the top new technology trend you must watch out for!

Machine Learning the subset of AI, is also being deployed in all kinds of industries, creating a huge demand for skilled professionals. Forrester predicts AI, machine learning, and automation will create 9 percent of new U.S. jobs by 2025, jobs including robot monitoring professionals, data scientists, automation specialists, and content curators, making it another new technology trend you must keep in mind too!

Mastering AI and machine learning will help you secure jobs like:

AI Research Scientist
AI Engineer
Machine Learning Engineer
AI Architect

 <h2 id="topic5">Extended Reality </h2>

 <p>
    
Extended reality comprises all the technologies that simulate reality, from Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality to Mixed Reality and everything else in-between. It is a significant technology trend right now as all of us are craving to break away from the so-called real boundaries of the world. By creating a reality without any tangible presence, this technology is massively popular amongst gamers, medical specialists, and retail and modeling.

Regarding extended reality, gaming is a crucial area for popular careers that don’t require high-level qualifications but rather a passion for online gaming. You can pursue game design, animation or even editing programs to pursue a successful career in this specialization. Meanwhile, check out the best jobs in AR, VR as well as ER:
